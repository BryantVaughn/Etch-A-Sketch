# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a fun Etch-A-Sketch simulator built to practice with DOM manipulation and event listeners. The minimum goal was to build a grid that would listen for a 'mouseover' event and change the background color.

### Extras

I went beyond the bare minimum and tried to challenge myself with styling and some CSS animations. For example, similar to the old Etch-A-Sketch drawing pads, the on-screen pad will shake when you clear your drawing screen! I also tried changing the styles on my color buttons by adding and removing CSS classes when they were clicked to simulate a 'pressed' effect.

### Retrospective

This project was a TON of fun to build. The minimum goal was slightly challenging, but adding the stretch goals to improve my knowledge of CSS animations and styling was well worth it. This is one of my favorite front-end projects I've built so far!
